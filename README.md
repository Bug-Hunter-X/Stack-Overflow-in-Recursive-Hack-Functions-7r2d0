This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions written in Hack: stack overflow. The code contains two functions, `foo` (factorial) and `bar` (summation). These functions, when called with sufficiently large inputs, will exceed the recursion depth limit, leading to a stack overflow error.  The solution demonstrates how to prevent this by using iterative approaches instead of recursion.
